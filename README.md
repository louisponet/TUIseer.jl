# TUIseer

Attempt to develop a modal TUI engine using [Overseer](https://github.com/louisponet/Overseer.jl) and [Term](https://github.com/FedeClaudi/Term.jl), and taking inspiration for the terminal handling from [Gameoji](https://github.com/c42f/Gameoji).

For an example see `run_term.jl` and `client.jl` in the `examples` directory.
